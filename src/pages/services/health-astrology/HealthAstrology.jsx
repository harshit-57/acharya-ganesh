                            When Medical Astrology plays a major role in this,
                            health astrology also plays a role in identifying
                            health issues in an individual’s life. Because the
                            planets and the 12 astrological signs have an impact
                            on different bodily parts, illnesses, meals, and

                            development. We can learn about someone’s
                            personality, strengths, weaknesses, and life path by
                            examining the positions of the planets and stars at
                            the moment of their birth. People can use our Health

                            have negative influences on these houses. To be
